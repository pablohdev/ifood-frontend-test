This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# iFood Frontend Test

Create a web application called Spotifood used to display the preferred playlists from iFood's customers. The web application has only one page:
* A page that lists the featured playlists at Spotify according to some criteria.

## Business rules

* The page is composed of two components:
    * One list of featured playlists
    * One filter component with API filter fields and one local search text input to filter the playlists by "name".
    
* The filter component should be used to filter the elements displayed by the list of featured playlists.
* The API filter fields and their possible values/type should be mounted by consuming this API **[1. Playlists Filters]** (http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a25fade2e0000213aa90776)
* The featured playlists to be displayed should be consumed from this API **[2. See the documentation from Spotify]** (https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-list-featured-playlists/)
* Every time the user change any information on the filter component, the list should be refresh accordingly. In case of API filter field change you should recall the playlists API with the filter parameters every time.
* Considering that we live in a chaotic and fast-changing world, the page should refresh its content every 30 seconds, to see if any information from the Spotify APIs had been changed.

## Hints or Constraints

We will use one API from Spotify Web API. You should follow the Spotify guide in order to create a token needed to access Spotify's API.
To mount the API filter fields on the filter component, you **must** consume the API that provides the metadata about the fields (Link 1).
You could use Material UI, Bootstrap or any other toolkit to accelerate your resolution. We will not provide any UI prototype or design.

## Non functional requirements

As this application will be a worldwide success, it must be prepared to be accessible, responsive, fault tolerant and resilient.
We **strongly recommend** using React to build the application.
Also, briefly elaborate on your solution architecture details, choice of patterns and frameworks.
